# no50:

50 Ohm series resistor, but no 50 Ohm termination resistor

# 50:

50 Ohm series resistor, 50 Ohm termination at the end of the leads.
This improves things due to reduced reflection.

# 50moved

50 Ohm series resistor, 50 Ohm termination close to the SMA, but still
long leads. This makes things worse due to increased reflection in the
non-impedance controlled leads.

# 50short

50 Ohm series resistor, 50 Ohm termination close to the SMA, and leads
shortened.

This gives the best result.
