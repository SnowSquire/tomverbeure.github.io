# IMPORTANT: Using the Right GPS Antenna

GPS signals are incredibly weak, so most GPS antennas are active ones that amplify the received signal 
inside the antenna before the signal is sent over the cable to the GPS receiver. Instead of a separate cable, 
the power for this amplifier is provided by the GPS receiver through the antenna cable. 

While most GPS receivers insert a 5VDC on the cable, Symmetricom equipment has the honor of being 
one of the few vendors that powers the GPS antenna with 12VDC. Or even better: this is only
true for some of their equipment. The SyncServer S200 is one of them. 

If you look for GPS antennas on Amazon, most will be 3V to 5V rated. You can find them for 

You can easily measure this voltage level with a multimeter by connecting the 2 leads to the ground
and the center pin of the SMA or BNC cable:

If you connect a 5V rates GPS cable to a 12V GPS receiver, chances are that you'll damage the antenna.

There are a couple of options to connect an antenna to a 12V GPS receiver:

* Use a 12V rated antenna
* Use a 5V GPS antenna and a bias tee with DC blocker to insert a seperate 5V 
* Modify your GPS receiver to output 5V instead of 12V
* Modify your GPS antenna to support 12V

Use the [HDD Raw Copy Tool](https://hddguru.com/software/HDD-Raw-Copy-Tool/).

# Getting Started

* Reset to factor default settings
* Use a static IP address

    You won't be able to connect with your browser otherwise!

# 10MHz Out

* 2.60Vpp AC

# Satellite status

```sh
ssh admin@192.168.1.201
gpsstrength
```

By default, there's only a simply command line processor the knows a few commands.

Boot procedure:
* Boots `_fsroot1` or `_fsroot2`.
* Overwrites /etc and /var with config.tar.gz data in the /persists partion.
* So you need to patch the config.tar.gz file!

* Use web interface to dump `syncServer.bkp` file

```sh
mkdir bak
cd bak
sudo tar xf ../syncServer.bkp
```

```
